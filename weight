# Weight-on-mars:To calculate weight on mars ,C++

#include <iostream> // Required for input/output operations

int main() {
    double weightEarth;
    double weightMars;
    
    // Define gravitational acceleration constants
    // Earth's gravitational acceleration (approximate) in m/s^2
    const double G_EARTH = 9.807; 
    // Mars's gravitational acceleration (approximate) in m/s^2
    const double G_MARS = 3.71;   

    // Prompt the user to enter the item's weight on Earth
    std::cout << "Enter the weight of the item on Earth (in Newtons or pounds): ";
    // Read the user's input
    std::cin >> weightEarth;

    // Calculate the weight on Mars
    // Weight on Mars = (Weight on Earth / G_EARTH) * G_MARS
    // This effectively calculates the mass first (Weight/G_EARTH), then multiplies by Mars's gravity
    weightMars = (weightEarth / G_EARTH) * G_MARS;

    // Display the calculated weight on Mars
    std::cout << "The item would weigh approximately " << weightMars << " on Mars." << std::endl;

    return 0; // Indicate successful programÂ execution
